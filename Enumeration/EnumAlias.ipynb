    "# Introduction to the enum aliases\n",
    "\n",
    "By definition, the enumeration member values are unique. However, we can create different member names with the same values.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the following defines the ``Color`` enumeration:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from enum import Enum\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "class Color(Enum):\n",
    "    RED = 1\n",
    "    CRIMSON = 1\n",
    "    SALMON = 1\n",
    "    GREEN = 2\n",
    "    BLUE = 3\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the ``Color`` enumeration has the ``RED``, ``CRIMSON``, and ``SALMON`` members with the same value 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we define multiple members in an enumeration with the same values, Python does not create different members but aliases.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the ``RED`` is the main member while the ``CRIMSON`` and ``SALMON`` members are the aliases of the ``RED`` member\n",
    "\n",
    "The following statements return ``True`` because ``CRIMSON`` and ``SALMON`` members are ``RED`` meber:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(Color.RED is Color.CRIMSON)\n",
    "print(Color.RED is Color.SALMON)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "True\n",
    "True\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When we look up a member by value, you’ll always get the main member, not aliases. For example, the following statement returns the RED member:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(Color(1)) # Color.RED\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When we iterate the members of an enumeration with aliases, we’ll get only the main members, not the aliases. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for color in Color:\n",
    "    print(color)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**It returns only three members:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Color.RED\n",
    "Color.GREEN\n",
    "Color.BLUE\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To get all the members including aliases, we need to use the ``__member__`` property of the enumeration class. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(Color.__members__)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "mappingproxy({'BLUE': <Color.BLUE: 3>,\n",
    "              'CRIMSON': <Color.RED: 1>,\n",
    "              'GREEN': <Color.GREEN: 2>,\n",
    "              'RED': <Color.RED: 1>,\n",
    "              'SALMON': <Color.RED: 1>})\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As shown clearly from the output, the ``CRIMSON`` and ``SALMON`` reference the same object which is referenced by the ``RED`` member:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "<Color.RED: 1>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to use enum aliases\n",
    "\n",
    "Enumeration aliases can be helpful in some situations. For example, suppose that we have to deal with API from two different systems. And each system has a different response status doe with the same meaning as shown in the following table:\n",
    "\n",
    "<table border=\"1\">\n",
    "  <tr>\n",
    "    <th>System 1</th>\n",
    "    <th>System 2</th>\n",
    "    <th>Meaning</th>\n",
    "  </tr>\n",
    "  <tr>\n",
    "    <td>REQUESTING</td>\n",
    "    <td>PENDING</td>\n",
    "    <td>The request is in progress</td>\n",
    "  </tr>\n",
    "  <tr>\n",
    "    <td>OK</td>\n",
    "    <td>FULFILLED</td>\n",
    "    <td>The request was completed successfully</td>\n",
    "  </tr>\n",
    "  <tr>\n",
    "    <td>NOT_OK</td>\n",
    "    <td>REJECTED</td>\n",
    "    <td>The request was failed</td>\n",
    "  </tr>\n",
    "</table>\n",
    "\n",
    "To standardize the status codes from these systems, we can use enumeration aliases as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "<table border=\"1\">\n",
    "  <tr>\n",
    "    <th>Your System</th>\n",
    "    <th>System 1</th>\n",
    "    <th>System 2</th>\n",
    "    <th>Meaning</th>\n",
    "  </tr>\n",
    "  <tr>\n",
    "    <td>IN_PROGRESS</td>\n",
    "    <td>REQUESTING</td>\n",
    "    <td>PENDING</td>\n",
    "    <td>The request is in progress</td>\n",
    "  </tr>\n",
    "  <tr>\n",
    "    <td>SUCCESS</td>\n",
    "    <td>OK</td>\n",
    "    <td>FULFILLED</td>\n",
    "    <td>The request was completed successfully</td>\n",
    "  </tr>\n",
    "  <tr>\n",
    "    <td>ERROR</td>\n",
    "    <td>NOT_OK</td>\n",
    "    <td>REJECTED</td>\n",
    "    <td>The request was failed</td>\n",
    "  </tr>\n",
    "</table>\n",
    "\n",
